<h2>GENERAL PREFACE TO THE<br />
EXPOSITOR'S BIBLE</h2>

<p class="center"><i>By the Editor.</i>,<br />
W. ROBERTSON NICOLL, M.A., LL.D.</p>


<p>The Expositor's Bible has been published in a period
of exceptionally active work in Biblical criticism. A
survey of recent study in the Old Testament and in the
New by very competent scholars is supplied in this
volume. I confine myself to general considerations.
Whatever criticism has accomplished or has not
accomplished, we may be sure that the supremacy and
the finality of the Bible are as they were, and will continue
secure and unassailable. The ultimate testimony
that the Bible is the Word of God cannot be derived
from external witness or from a process of reasoning.
It is in the heart of the believer to whom the voice of
God is personal, and it is given by the Holy Spirit that
still bears witness in and with the Word. It is and has
always been to the Church not a matter of probable
evidence, but one of Divine certainty. If we could see
the living Church! It would be much to see the
Church Triumphant, and in a sense that privilege is
ours. For we are come to Mount Zion where God has
set His King, to the festal host and Church of the firstborn
which are written in Heaven. Yet a hush hangs
over the everlasting hills, and the light that falls on
them now for us is but starlight to the glory that
clothes them. But what if we could see the living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
in Christ, if the sheath of the Church Visible should
suddenly fall away and the flower of the Church Invisible
should unfold itself before our eyes. Those who
have heard in His written Word the true voice of God
are the Church Invisible, and it is to them and to them
only that the conviction of its Divine riches is assured.
But even for them&mdash;and in these days this is specially
true&mdash;there are difficulties about the content, the
meaning, and the form of Scripture. Upon these there
are great differences, but there is ground on which we
may all meet. There are arguments which appeal to
every Christian heart for the finality of the Word of
God.</p>

<p>We are in the first place, confronted by the fact of
the permanent and inextinguishable life of the Bible.
No engrossment of the general mind with secularities,
no change in the methods of thought, no discovery of
science, and no achievement of literature puts the Bible
out of court. It and it alone ministers to the permanent
and universal cravings of our being. Sir Thomas
Browne puts it well: "Men's works have an age like
themselves, and though they outlive their authors, yet
have they a stint and period to their duration. This
only is a work too hard for the teeth of time, and
cannot perish but in the general flames when all things
will confess their ashes." The words are as true as
when they were written, and they will be as true at any
future period, however long this frame of things may
last. We will not even quarrel with the thought that
the Bible itself will come to be no longer needed, for
we shall in the end be content to have no Scripture
but the Living Word Himself. Now it is this which
sharply distinguishes the Bible from every other book.
There are, said one, three classes of books. There is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the book you read once, the book you read twice, and
the book you read every year. There is besides the
Book which you read constantly, which morning by
morning, evening by evening, brings its message of
help. Other books, even the greatest, exhaust their
message. Take, for example, the sermons of Frederick
Robertson. What startling freshness there was in
them on a first reading! Go back to them now, and
you find that very much of their message has passed
into the substance of contemporary thought. The
Bible has been and ever is yielding messages, and yet
returning to it you ever find, and the generations ever
find, that it has more to say. We may, indeed, read it
heedlessly and find it old. But who that reads it with
a wistful heart will ever have this experience? "I
sometimes look back," said one, "to those simple days
when my spiritual life was commencing, when I used
to go forth to my labours with the New Testament in
my pocket, that I might glance over its pages at the
next leisure moment. I read it with fresh, unworn,
unspeakable interest. It was like Adam's first walk
in Paradise." It has been told of some saints whose
minds had in their day roamed over the field of knowledge,
that as life drew up to the end they read almost
nothing except the Bible, feeling every time that they
were only beginning to understand it.</p>

<p>The significance of this is not that the Bible is a
great achievement of literature, not that it is the
noblest and sublimest of all books, but that it is the
final revelation of God. There is a dangerous form of
apologetics which aims at establishing that the Bible
is the most remarkable book in the world. That parts
of the Bible are of the noblest literary beauty is certain.
That some at least of the human authors were transcendently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
gifted is equally certain. For example, this
is eminently true of the unknown author of the Book of
Job, a book which, as Froude says, will be found at the
last to tower above all the poetry of the world. It is
so with the unknown author of the Epistle to the
Hebrews, who has been truly if quaintly, described
as "a man of the first intellectual mark." It is true of
St. Paul, whose intellect was very receptive, that even
when most receptive, most powerful, an instrument, an
<i>organon</i>, not a mere speaking trumpet. For St. Paul
the glory of the Cross flooded the world, smote with
death its principles and creeds, created new scenery,
new horizons, new faiths, new understandings. But
we cannot affirm all this about every author of the
Bible or every part of it, and we need not do so. What
we say is that this book and this book only contains
all we know of God, all we shall know till the veil is
rent. Let me emphasize this assertion. An American
poet has said:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Slowly the Bible of the race is writ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each age, each kindred, adds a text to it."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>This is a statement that we meet with a blank denial.
No text has been added to the Bible. No revelation of
God has been given or will be given in addition to that
within its covers. You say God has revealed Himself
by His skill and power in nature. He has revealed
Himself by His providence in history. He has revealed
Himself in the individual life of believers. He has
revealed Himself by His Spirit to His Church. He has
in a sense inspired the books of devotion that are the
treasures of the world. The Holy Spirit has promised
to take of the things of Christ and show them to every
believer. Yes, it is all true. But what has God said in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
nature, in Providence, in Christian experience, in
Christian literature that He has not said first in the
Bible? Take the most beautiful thought ever suggested
by the profoundest Christian mind, and you
will find it quietly folded in some word of Jesus, in
some argument of an Apostle. This was the argument
for the inspiration of the Gospel on which my old
teacher, Dr. Robertson Smith, was specially wont to
dwell. "We mean," he said, "that the Bible contains
within itself a perfect picture of God's gracious relations
to man, and that we have no need to go outside
of the Bible history to know anything of God and His
saving will toward us, that the whole growth of the
true religion up to its perfect fulness is set before us in
the record of God's dealings with Israel, culminating in
the manifestation of Jesus Christ. History has not
taught us that there is anything in true religion to add
to the New Testament. We still stand in the nineteenth
century where Christ stood in the first, or rather
Christ stands as high above us as He did above His
disciples, the perfect Master, the supreme Head of the
fellowship of all true religion." Even so, as Christ
stands, and forever will stand, infinitely above us, so
does the Bible stand, and ever will stand, infinitely
above all other books. Consider what this claim of
finality means in an age when everything is changing,
when our books of history, science, and philosophy last
only a few years. Think what it is to say this in the
face of the lights that are now streaming in on all sides
upon the human soul. Think also that this statement
cannot be challenged by any Christian. No Christian
knows anything about God but what has been already
written in the Word of God. The experience of the
saints runs with these words: "I had little thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
its intellectual grandeur or literary beauty. Christ
was there. I went to Him for life and found it. I was
baptized and absorbed in His dying love."</p>

<p>But the question may be raised, has been raised, Is
it right to describe the Bible as the Word of God? Is
it possible to vindicate such a name for the whole Bible
in the face of criticism and its results? Is it not better to
say that the Bible contains the Word of God? I think it
is possible to use the phrase "Word of God" in a sense
that is not justified. But the phrase, "the Bible is the
Word of God," expresses a truth which is denied in the
other phrase, "the Bible contains the Word of God."
I appeal again to Dr. Robertson Smith, whose place
among Biblical scholars will not lightly be contested.
He says: "People now say that the Scripture contains
God's Word, when they mean that part of the Bible is
the Word of God and another part is the word of man.
That is not the doctrine of our churches, which hold
that the substance of <i>all</i> Scripture is God's Word.
What is not part of the record of God's Word is no
part of Scripture. Only we must distinguish between
the record and the Divine communications of God's
heart and will which the record conveys." Defining
his position still further, the same illustrious scholar
said: "We may say that silver is contained in the
mould into which it is run. If the silver is only in the
leaden ore, the man who has no means of smelting is
no richer by having it in his possession. If the Bible
only contains the Word of God mixed with man's word,
like silver in the leaden ore, then no one could use
Scripture for his own religious life who did not possess
the requisite scholarship, as in the other case the man
could not get silver without having a smelting to
separate it from the leaden ore. Therefore that view is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
untenable. But there is another way in which Scripture
may contain the Word of God, the pure Word of
God&mdash;as the mould contains the silver seven times
tried. The pure silver takes the shape of the mould&mdash;it
may be an imperfect shape&mdash;but it is pure silver, and
the man is enriched thereby at once without any
further act."</p>

<p>Once more, when Biblical criticism has done its
utmost, when every one of its established results is
acknowledged to the full, there is still a problem.
Grant the furthest claim of the critical analysis.
Divide the Bible as you have it into innumerable
shreds, painted differently. What then? You have
not explained the living combination. How were these
innumerable scraps brought together and endowed
with this indomitable vitality? It is the same problem
as is presented in Christianity. The parts, as an apologist
has said, may be taken to pieces, and people may
persuade themselves that without Divine interposition
they can account for all the facts. "Here is something
from the Jews, something from the Greeks, an element
contributed by this party, another by that, a general
coloring by people who held partly of both. You may
take down Christianity in this way, and spread it over
the centuries. But when the operation is done the
living whole draws itself together again, looks you in
the face, reclaims its scattered parts from every century
back to the first, and reasserts itself to be a great
burst of coherent life and light centring in Christ.
Just as though you might take a piece of living tissue
and say, here is only so much nitrogen, carbon, lime,
and so forth, but the energetic peculiarities of life
going on before your eyes would refute you by the
palpable presence of a mystery unaccounted for." So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
it is with the Bible. How were these elements put
together? Who breathed into the whole the breath of
life so that it became a living creature, as Luther says,
with eyes and hands and feet? Take the problem of
the Gospels. One may say lazily that it is an insoluble
problem, and one may say it wisely. In any case, how
was it that these writers succeeded in drawing the
picture of the Stainless? How was it that the stream
was never allowed to become turbid at any moment?
One act, one word, one attitude might have been condemned
by all generations of the faithful. How were
they kept from misunderstandings, these men who
were always misunderstanding, when the story came
to be written? An artist and poet of great note died
some twenty years ago, and quite a number of his
friends have put on record their impressions. The
most intimate of these friends has refrained. He has
contented himself with saying that they have all
missed the true man, the heroic, the noble man. Are
we not in the presence of the supernatural in dealing
with a fact like this, that the sinful should understand
the Sinless so perfectly as to record no thought, no
deed, no word which bears upon it the mark of their
human frailty? Shelley said once: "There are two
Italys, one of the green earth, the transparent seas, old
ruins, the warm, radiant atmosphere; the other is of
the Italians, with their works and ways." There are
two Bibles, the Bible cut in pieces by analysis, the
Bible as we have it. The time will come when one will
pass into the other, but it will not come till the finality
and Divinity of the Bible are confessed, just as the
moment will come when the spell of Italy will pass
into the soul of her people, and the contrast will fade
away. What we say about the Bible, when admitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
everything that criticism has secured, is that criticism
has only made it clearer than ever that it is a house
not made with hands.</p>

<p>Once more, and especially of the Old Testament, we
have the witness of Christ. This is a witness which
has been misunderstood and overdriven. But in its
essence it is a witness which is admitted by believing
critics themselves to be absolute. To us it is not
enough to say that Jesus Christ is an inspired soul,
obedient to the laws of His own nature. It is not
enough even to say that He holds a regal rank among
souls and an exceptional relation to God. It is not
enough to say that He is the Saint of saints. He is
more than that, even very God of very God. But take
the lower position. Admit everything that can be
urged in the circumstances of His humanity, and still
it remains true, as Dr. Robertson Smith has said that
"there can be no question that Jesus Himself believed
that God dealt with Israel in the way of special revelation,
that the Old Testament contains within itself a
perfect picture of His gracious relations to His people,
and sets forth the whole growth of the true religion
up to its perfect fulness." Dr. Robertson Smith added:
"We cannot depart from this view without making
Jesus an imperfect teacher and an imperfect Saviour."
Did He who said, "No man knoweth the Father but
the Son and he to whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal
Him," did He mistake His Father for another in the
pages of the Old Testament? It is incredible, incredible
upon any theory of the person of Christ that can be
held by Christians.</p>

<p>"The Spirit of God maketh the reading, and especially
the preaching, of the Word an effectual means of
convincing and converting sinners," says the Shorter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Catechism. Is it so certain that the preaching comes
before the reading? Human words, when they are
best, give the forms of what truth the speakers see, but
the brightest forms have neither the lustre nor the
grace of the forms of the Spirit. They are at best poor,
dull, inharmonious echoes of the heavenly music, and
it is through the Word of the Lord pre-eminently that
the power of the Lord must spread from heart to heart.</p>

<h2>GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO THE<br />
EXPOSITOR'S BIBLE</h2>

<h3>OLD TESTAMENT</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By W. H. Bennett</span>, M. A., D. D.<br />
Professor of Old Testament Exegesis at New College, London</p>


<p class="center">I.&mdash;PLAN OF THE SERIES</p>

<p>The Expositor's Bible is unique. There have been
innumerable commentaries, homiletical, didactic, exegetical,
and critical; mostly dealing with the books text by
text, or paragraph by paragraph. This series adopts a
different method. It aims at bringing out the general
teaching of each book, and of each of the divisions into
which the book naturally falls. The reader is furnished
with all the information necessary to enable him to
understand the history, philosophy, and theology, the
practical wisdom and devotional poetry of the Sacred
Scriptures; but his mind is not bewildered by abstruse
technicalities, and his attention is not distracted from the
main issues by long discussions on minor details. This
plan has, of course, been partially anticipated, there have
been similar expositions of books or portions of books;
such expositions have usually been sections of elaborate
works; but in the Expositor's Bible we have for the first
time a series exclusively devoted to such exposition, and
embracing the whole Bible. The series illustrates the
catholicity of scholarship; its contributors represent several
Evangelical churches, and various schools of Biblical
Criticism. There are Anglicans like the Bishop of Derry,
Presbyterians like Prof. G. A. Smith, and English Free
Churchmen like Dr. Maclaren.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>II.&mdash;THE NEED FOR A NEW EXPOSITION OF THE
OLD TESTAMENT</p>

<p>"Of old time God spake unto the fathers in the
prophets by divers portions and in divers manners."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>In the Old Testament we have the record of this Revelation
so far as the mind could grasp the Divine utterance
and so far as words could describe the Heavenly Vision.
Ever since the Epistle to the Hebrews was written, and
for that matter even earlier, devout Jews and Christians
have been busy with the interpretation of the Scriptures
of the Old Covenant. Not only so, but also the inspired
words of prophets and psalmists, sown in the good soil
of believing hearts, have brought forth an abundant harvest
of theological and devotional literature. The Old
Testament and the literature of which it has been the
occasion form an important portion of the Christian
inheritance.</p>

<p>Each new generation needs to take stock afresh of this
sacred legacy, so that it may obtain from ancient learning,
study and inspiration the true message for its own times.
The tares must be gathered out from the wheat, and the
chaff separated from the grain. Truth, too, constantly
needs re-statement; language and ideas are always changing;
words and phrases do not convey to us the same
meaning as they did to our grandfathers. Religious
teaching deals largely in metaphors, and a metaphor may
be a guiding light to one generation, and a will-o'-the-wisp
to the next. As times change, aspects of the truth once
prominent may be passed over lightly, and new views of
the same truth must be emphasized to suit the needs of a
new dispensation. The church in its age-long pilgrimage
ever attains new heights from which it beholds a wider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
range of the vast expanse of sacred truth; for the most
part it is the same landscape which was seen of old; but
something is lost to sight, some tracts which once filled the
field of vision have become dim and small; new glories are
revealed, and the true relations of mountain, valley, and
plain, of river, lake, and sea are discerned as they never
were before. Commentators and expositors have not
merely to repeat the shibboleths of forgotten controversies,
they have the more onerous task of making the new
view of the Heavenly Vision an intelligible, living, speaking
picture for the men and women of their day.</p>

<p>At the time when the publication of this series began
there was urgent need for a new exposition of the Old
Testament. The nineteenth century had obtained wonderful
results from research in science and history, and
from the progress of thought in philosophy, criticism,
and theology; men were dazzled with new facts and new
ideas. How were they to understand the Bible in the
light&mdash;one might almost say in the glare&mdash;of this new
truth?</p>

<p>The scientific researches associated with the names of
Wallace and Darwin, and with the term Evolution, have
altogether changed our ideas of Nature and man, and of
their relation to each other. Our knowledge of the history
of the race is fuller and deeper than it was, and goes
back to a far more remote antiquity. Democracy both as
an idea and as a practical system is affecting thought, feeling,
and character as it never did before, both for good
and evil. This latter feature is perhaps one cause of the
modern tenderness towards acute physical pain, and this
tenderness, again, has done much to modify the sterner
doctrines of the old theology. In many other ways too
theology has become, as some would say, more vague;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
or, as others would prefer to put it, more elastic and better
able to adapt itself to the varied circumstances of life.</p>

<p>We may now turn to departments of research specially
connected with the Old Testament. We may begin with
Egyptology and Assyriology, it being understood that the
latter is even more concerned with the literature, history,
and religion of Babylon than with that of Assyria. During
the middle of the nineteenth century the excavations
in the East have restored its buried empires to the light
of history; they have enabled us to study the Sacred story
in connection with the great international system of Egypt
and Western Asia; and they have shown us how closely
Israel was connected with the peoples of the Nile and the
Euphrates in commerce, politics, and religion. But the
study of the faith and worship of Israel side by side with
those of Egypt and Babylon is only part of the science of
comparative religion. Recent research has taught us
many things concerning the faiths of the world; and the
unique character of the Old Testament Revelation can
only be understood when it is compared with the religious
practices and ideas of other peoples. Moreover, the discoveries
in Egypt and Assyria, and the study of Eastern
life, furnish many new illustrations of the manners and
customs of Israel; and the new knowledge of Semitic languages
enables us to correct many defects in the Authorized
Version of the Old Testament. Indeed the publication
of the Revised Version clearly demanded a revised
exposition.</p>

<p>Again, the new exegesis had to consider results in other
departments of study, <i>e. g.</i>, the Lower and the Higher
Criticism. Something had been done in the Lower Criticism,
or the discussion in detail of the text of the Sacred
Books; but here the changes were comparatively unimportant;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and even now our knowledge of this subject is
very inadequate from the point of view of scholarship,
though the text is determined with an accuracy sufficient
for practical purposes. It was very different, however,
in what is known as the Higher Criticism, <i>i. e.</i>, the discussion
of the date, authorship, and composition of the
books of the Old Testament. Higher critics of one
school, following those of former generations, were inclined,
for the most part, to assign the books as they stood
to the authors whose names were given as their titles.
For instance the whole of the Pentateuch, with the exception
of Deuteronomy, xxxiv, 5-8, was ascribed to Moses;
the whole of <i>Isaiah</i> to the prophet of the time of Hezekiah;
and all the Davidic Psalms to David. But for
about a century this subject had been studied from
another point of view, by a school of critics who were
inclined to neglect tradition, and to take for their motto
"Prove all things." The principles of this school are
clearly and eloquently set forth in the following quotation
from Prof. Sayce;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the passage refers to the sacred books
of Babylonia, but the principles are of universal application.</p>

<p>"Before we can understand it (a collection of sacred
books) properly, we must separate the elements of
which it consists, and assign to each its chronological
position.</p>

<p>"The very fact, however, that religious texts are
usually of immemorial antiquity, and that changes
inevitably pass over them as they are handed down in
successive editions, makes such a task peculiarly difficult.
Nevertheless it is a task which must be undertaken
before we have the right to draw a conclusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
from the texts with which we deal. We must first
know whether ... they are composite or the
products of a single author and epoch; whether, lastly,
they have been glossed and interpolated, and their
primitive meaning transformed. We must have a
chronology for our documents ... and beware ... of
interpreting the creations of one age as if
they were the creations of another."</p>

<p>The application of these principles to the Hebrew
Scriptures has had startling results. If two tables
were compiled showing the date and authorship of the
various books, one according to the traditional school
of higher criticism,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> the other according to the school
with which we are now dealing,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> the two would present
a marked contrast to each other. The new school
would hold, for instance, that the bulk of the Pentateuch
is not in its present form the work of Moses;
that the last twenty-seven chapters of our Book of
Isaiah were not composed by that prophet; and that
very few of the Davidic Psalms were really written
by David. At the time when the first volumes of the
Expositor's Bible were published this school had become
large and influential; and public attention had
been called to their teaching by the attacks on Prof.
W. Robertson Smith, one of their leading representatives.
The new criticism affected not only purely literary
questions but also the views to be taken of the
history and religion of Israel. The history before
Saul, it was maintained, was not so fully and definitely
known as had been supposed; and the religion of Israel
had developed, under the influence of Revelation, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
a primitive faith which had much in common with that
of other Semitic peoples. Here again we can illustrate
the alleged results of the new criticism by a passage
from Prof. Sayce: "It is to Babylonia, therefore, that
we must look for the origin of those views of the future
world and of the punishment of sin<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> which have left so
deep an impression on the pages of the Old Testament.... They
were views from which
the Israelite was long in emancipating himself.
The inner history of the Old Testament is, in fact, in
large measure a history of the gradual widening of
the religious consciousness of Israel in regard to them
and their suppression by a higher and more spiritual
form of faith."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>In the Expositor's Bible both the old and the new
schools of criticism are represented. Thus a great
opportunity was offered to critics; and a crucial experiment
was tried which was of the utmost importance
to all Christian Churches. When the books of the
Old Testament were read in the light of the new
criticism, would it still be possible to derive from them
a consistent and reasonable account of the history and
religion of Israel; would they still stimulate and nourish
Christians' faith, piety, and devotion, and minister
to the needs of the spiritual life? The volumes of this
series written by representatives of the new school of
criticism have enabled us, it is claimed, to answer this
question with an emphatic affirmative. For the general
public the first volume of Prof. Geo. Adam Smith's
<i>Isaiah</i> was an epoch-making book, revealing undreamed-of
possibilities in the way of fresh light breaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
forth from the ancient Scriptures. <i>The British Weekly</i>
wrote of this work, "Isaiah is for the first time made
perfectly intelligible to the people.... Mr. Smith
has opened out a new line of work ... which will
do more than many arguments to reconcile a timorous
and misguided public to scientific scholarship and the
newer criticism."</p>

<p>Another modern tendency which influences the
interpretation of the Old Testament is the decay of
ecclesiastical authority. There are still, and always
will be, those who are willing to believe anything on
the bare word of their favorite preacher. But in the
long run this kind of faith does not count. On the
other hand there are many, religious or capable of
religion, to whom it would seem absurd to suggest that
the decrees of Churches had any great value in matters
of faith. As regards the Old Testament, for instance,
neither the creeds of ancient councils nor the resolutions
of modern synods, neither papal bulls nor episcopal
edicts could seriously affect the attitude of such
men to, say, <i>Canticles</i>, <i>Ecclesiastes</i> and <i>Esther</i>. The
testimony of the Church Universal&mdash;of which creeds,
confessions, and other standards are the least important
part&mdash;induces inquirers to read the Bible. But in
religion, an authority is only effective by its own inherent
force; it must be able to assert itself so as to
win sympathy, to produce conviction, and to secure
obedience. A distinguished Cambridge scholar is in
the habit of saying, when he is asked how he "takes"
a passage, that he does not take the passage, but the
passage takes him. So the great sayings, discourses,
and narratives of the Old Testament take hold of their
readers and compel acknowledgment of the authority
of Revelation. The best we can do for the Bible is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
let it speak for itself; the only essential doctrine of
Scripture is that it is the duty and privilege of every
man to read it, and to read intelligently, taking
advantage of all the light afforded by history,
archæology and criticism. The great object of the
Expositor's Bible has been just this&mdash;to let the Bible
speak for itself.</p>


<p class="center">III.&mdash;RECENT RELIGIOUS LITERATURE&mdash;GENERAL.</p>

<p>Criticism has powerfully stimulated public interest
in the Bible, and the wealth of new information and
new ideas has produced an extensive popular literature
on the Sacred Scriptures. The traditional etiquette
which demanded that the Bible should be marked off
from all other books by its sombre binding and its
arrangement in chapters and verses has been rudely
set aside. Almost every possible variety of editions
have been published of late years&mdash;Bibles of every
shape and size, from the portly quarto for the lectern
to the dainty series of duodecimo volumes for the
pocket; Bibles with and without notes or illustrations;
Bibles treated as classic literature; Bibles bound in
cheerful colors with æsthetic tooling. It has become
possible to read the Scriptures in a railway train without
being guilty of pharasaic ostentation. At the
same time there has been a deluge of "Helps," "Companions,"
"Teachers' Notes," etc., etc., intended to
supply the latest information in popular, but sometimes
a little misleading as to the critical results of
modern, Biblical study.</p>

<p>But the most important feature of recent literature for
ordinary Bible students is the publication of standard
works of reference in which the real results of modern
research are made accessible. For nearly thirty years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Smith's <i>Dictionary of the Bible</i>, in its English and American
editions, rendered invaluable service; and a revision
of this work was published some time since. But just
recently two entirely new Bible Dictionaries have been
published in which British, American, Dutch, German
and Swiss scholars of all the Evangelical Churches,
together with one or two learned Jews, co-operate.</p>

<p>Dr. Hastings' <i>Dictionary of the Bible</i><a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> represents the
more conservative position, while somewhat more advanced
views find expression in the <i>Encyclopædia Biblica</i>,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
edited by Prof. Cheyne and Dr. J. Sutherland Black.</p>

<p>In all this literary activity, the various Bible Societies
have taken an important part; chiefly through their instrumentality
the Bible in whole or in part has been translated
into over 400 languages, and probably since the invention
of printing about 300,000,000 copies of the Scriptures or
of portions have been put into circulation. An important
feature in this work is the decision of the <i>British and
Foreign Bible Society</i> to circulate the Revised Version&mdash;a
step all the more significant as it followed shortly after
the publication of the American edition of the Revised
Version, and the vote of the Anglican Convocation
approving of the reading of the new translation in the
services of the English Established Church.</p>

<p>The last fifteen or twenty years have seen a great growth
of religious journalism. Popular periodicals have multiplied;
and several important theological reviews have
been started in England and America, notably the <i>Critical
Review</i>, the <i>Hibbert Journal</i>, and the <i>American Journal
of Theology</i>.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>IV.&mdash;-THE PROGRESS OF ARCHÆOLOGY.</p>

<p>The years since the publication of our series began, in
1887, have witnessed marked progress in the study of the
Old Testament, of which we propose to give a brief
sketch, beginning with the Archæology, <i>i. e.</i>, chiefly the
results of excavations in Egypt, and in Syria, Assyria,
Babylonia, and Arabia. The last fifteen years have made
immense additions to the known facts which have a bearing
on the history and religion of Israel, and the interpretation
of the Hebrew Scriptures. Assiduous exploration
is continually pushing back our knowledge of the
ancient East to a more and more remote antiquity, so that
already we discern the dim outlines of history in what
we have been wont to call prehistoric times. We seem to
know something of life in Egypt in B. C. 7000 or it may
be even B. C. 10,000. At the same time our knowledge
of later periods is continually increasing, though comparatively
little is found that directly and explicitly either
confirms or contradicts the Old Testament. Perhaps the
most relevant amongst recent discoveries is an inscription
of Meneptah II. This king is often spoken of in popular
handbooks as the "Pharaoh of the Exodus," and his
father and predecessor Rameses II is referred to as the
"Pharaoh of the Oppression." But in this newly found
inscription Meneptah claims to have subdued Israelites
in Syria.</p>

<p>But the most striking amongst recent discoveries is the
collection known as the <i>Tell el'Amarna Tablets</i>, found
at Amarna in the Nile Valley in 1887. They form a
connecting link between Egyptology and Assyriology,
and bring forth their relation with Palestine. For,
though they are part of the archives of the Foreign
Office of Amenophis IV, B. C. 1400, they are, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
most part, written in the cuneiform Babylonian, and consist
of despatches to the Pharaohs from Babylonian,
Hittite, and other Eastern kings, and from the Egyptian
officials, and tributaries in Palestine, and the rest of Syria.
These letters throw a flood of light on the condition of
Western Asia. We see, for instance, that at that time
Palestine and Ph&oelig;nicia were provinces of the Egyptian
Empire.</p>

<p>It is also maintained by many scholars that certain
invaders of Palestine, the <i>Habiri</i>, who figure largely in
these letters, are the Hebrews, although the period is at
least a century earlier than the time of the so-called
"Pharaohs of the Oppression and the Exodus."</p>

<p>In Palestine, at Lachish and Gezer, the explorers have
unearthed the remains of the successive races which one
after another ruled in the land.</p>

<p>In Babylonia, there has been quite recently a great
"find" of the laws, official letters and other documents
of Hammurabi, B. C. 2300, usually identified with the
Amraphel of Genesis XIV, the contemporary of Abraham.
These and other discoveries have led Paul Haupt,
Winckler, Sayce, Fried. Delitzsch and other scholars to
attribute to Babylon a predominant influence, social,
political, and religious in the ancient East. Hence Fried.
Delitzsch's famous lectures before the German Emperor,
in which that distinguished Assyriologist treated the
religion of Israel almost as an inferior offshoot from that
of Babylon, and initiated a controversy which is still
raging. These discoveries are so frequent and so
extensive that there is little encouragement to anyone to
attempt to write an adequate and comprehensive account
of them. However complete it might be when written,
fresh discoveries would probably come to hand even before
it was published, and it would rapidly become more and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
more out of date. Nevertheless a full statement up to
certain dates may be found in the works of the scholars
mentioned above and others such as Hommel, Jastrow,
Jensen, Budge, Zimmern, Flinders Petrie, etc.; in the
proceedings and transactions of the various American,
English, French, and German Exploration Societies; in
the most recent commentaries and works on the History
and Religion of Israel.</p>

<p>What is specially known in Germany as Archæology,
viz., the study of manners and customs, has been brought
up to date in two standard German works by Nowack
and Benzinger, respectively.</p>

<p>We may briefly refer here to the rapid development in
recent times of the science of Comparative Religion,
to which amongst others, Prof. C. H. Toy, of Harvard,
has rendered important services. A marked feature has
been the tendency to emphasize the legends and ritual of
savage tribes, and their survivals in the literature and
services of more advanced religions. Attempts are made
to ascertain from such data how religions in general,
and any given religion in particular, have developed;
and thus lay down principles by which to interpret the
available information in any special case. In reference
to this branch of learning Prof. Morris Jastrow of
the University of Pennsylvania writes thus<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>: "J. G.
Frazer's great work more particularly, <i>The Golden
Bough</i>, marks an epoch in the study of religious rites."</p>


<p class="center">V.&mdash;PROGRESS IN PHILOLOGY, ETC.</p>

<p>Many important additions have recently been made to
the student's apparatus for the linguistic and textual
study of the Old Testament. Numerous grammars,
reading-books and lexicons of Assyrian and other Semitic
languages have been published. In Hebrew itself a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
standard grammar has been provided by the translation
of the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth editions Gesenius
revised by Kautzsch. Dr. Solomon Mandelkern has published
a new Concordance to the Hebrew Text of the
Old Testament. A new standard edition of Gesenius
Lexicon by Profs. Brown, Driver, and Briggs is being
issued by the Clarendon Press.</p>

<p>Biblical Hebrew has also had light thrown on it by
the discovery of the original Hebrew text of large portions
of <i>Ecclesiasticus</i>. It was indeed maintained by
Margoliouth that the documents discovered were a
retranslation into Hebrew from Greek and other versions;
but, after much controversy, the verdict of scholarship
is in favor of the originality of the Hebrew text in these
documents.</p>

<p>As regards the Septuagint: Prof. Swete has edited
a small edition in three volumes with the readings of
the most important manuscripts, together with a fourth
volume containing the Introduction. A large edition
which will give the same text<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> "with an ample <i>apparatus
criticus</i> intended to provide material for a critical
determination of the text," is being prepared. Messrs.
Hatch and Redpath have compiled a new Concordance to
the Septuagint; but a modern grammar and lexicon are
still "felt wants."</p>


<p class="center">VI.&mdash;RECENT CRITICISM AND EXEGESIS.</p>

<p>The progress of Biblical knowledge has necessitated
the publication of new series of commentaries. In English
there is the International Critical Commentary;<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and
some of the later volumes of the Cambridge Bible, <i>e. g.</i>,
Prof. Driver's <i>Daniel</i>, are rather first-class commentaries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>for scholars than elementary works for general
readers. In German there are Prof. Nowack's <i>Handkommentar
zum Alten Testament</i>;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Prof. Karl Marti's
<i>Kurzer Handkommentar zum Alten Testament</i>,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and the
Old Testament sections of Profs. Strack and Zöckler's
<i>Kurzgefaszter Kommentar</i>.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Later on reference will
be made to some volumes of these series.</p>

<p>In addition to the above works, there are others specially
intended to show how criticism has divided up
the books of the Old Testament into the various older
documents from which they are believed to have been
compiled. This analysis is shown in the German translation
edited by Kautzsch by means of initials in the margin;
Dr. Haupt's <i>Sacred Books of the Old Testament</i>
(Hebrew text) and <i>Polychrome Bible</i>,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> by means of
colored backgrounds on which the text is printed;
and in the <i>Oxford Society of Historical Theology</i>; <i>The
Hexateuch</i><a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> by means of parallel columns. The introduction
to the last named work is the most complete
popular statement of the grounds for the modern theory
of the Pentateuch. Technical details and a formal contrast
of the arguments for and against this theory may
be found in the discussion between Profs. W. R. Harper
and W. H. Green in <i>Hebraica</i>, 1888-90. Numerous
Introductions to the Old Testament have expounded the
current critical views, notably for English and American
readers the successive editions of Prof. Driver's <i>Introduction
to the Literature of the Old Testament</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p><p>Naturally these various works represent not merely the
position of criticism and exegesis twenty years ago, but
also the progress made since then. As regards the Historical
Books critics have chiefly been engaged in the
application of modern methods and principles which are
now very generally accepted. Development has taken
place in three directions. First, much labor has been
given to the more exact distribution of the contents of the
<i>Hexateuch</i> between the main documents used by its compilers,
<i>e. g.</i>, Prof. B. W. Bacon's analysis of <i>Exodus</i>.
Secondly, attempts have been made to divide up these
main documents into still older documents from which
they have been compiled. Steuernagel, for instance, regards
<i>Deuteronomy</i> as a mosaic of paragraphs and
clauses from earlier codes, and finds a criterion between
different sources in the use, respectively, of the singular
or the plural form of address. So far his views have not
met with much acceptance.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Thirdly, the theory has been
very widely advocated that the historical books of <i>Judges-I
Kings</i> are partly compiled from the documents used
by the editors of the Hexateuch.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Gunkel's commentary
on <i>Genesis</i><a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> is of special importance; it pleads for
a fuller recognition of the indebtedness of Israel
to the religions of its neighbors, and maintains that,
as the stories of the Creation, the Fall, and the Flood
were derived from Babylon, so the Patriarchal narratives
were mostly borrowed from the Canaanites after the settlement
of Israel in Palestine. The account of Joseph,
however, is largely taken from Egyptian sources.</p>

<p>As regards the Prophetical Books, there is little of general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
interest to record; the composite authorship of
Isaiah XL-LXVI is more widely held.</p>

<p>When we come to the <i>Hagiographa</i>, or third or closing
section of the Hebrew Canon, <i>Esther</i> has been the subject
of interesting speculations. Chiefly because Mordecai
and Esther are the names of the Babylonian gods Merodach
and Ishtar, it has been suggested that the book is
based on a Babylonian myth which the Jews appropriated
and adapted, as in earlier days, according to Gunkel, they
made use of the legends of the Canaanites.</p>

<p>The origin and history of the <i>Psalms</i> is still made the
ground of much controversy, and the tendency of criticism
is to deny the existence of any Pre-exilic Psalms;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
and to assign a large number to the Maccabean period.
It is even held<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> that, in the time of the Maccabees, the
Psalm was the organ of political invective, and played the
part of the leading article in a modern newspaper.</p>

<p>In connection with <i>Canticles</i> a theory put forward
some time since has been revived in an emended form,
and with a fuller discussion of the evidence.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> This
view is that "the book is a collection of songs, connected
with a Syrian custom, called the 'King's Week.' During
the first week after marriage the bride and bridegroom
play at being king and queen, and are addressed as such
by a mock court, in a series of songs similar to those of
<i>Canticles</i>. Thus <i>Canticles</i> would contain a specimen of

<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>VII.&mdash;THE HISTORY OF ISRAEL AND ITS RELIGION.</p>

<p>Many works have appeared expounding these subjects
in the light of modern criticism.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Here again recent work
has largely been a development on lines already laid
down.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Much attention has been given to the hints
furnished by the Pentateuch as to the early history of
Israel, and these have been compared with recent discoveries
from the monuments. Many scholars<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> maintain
that the Twelve Tribes of later history represent groups
of ancient nomadic clans who wandered in Western Asia
long before the time of Moses; that only a section of
these groups went down into Egypt and escaped with
Moses, and that these invaded Canaan at one period, while
other kindred clans reinforced them at a later time.
Israel and the Twelve Tribes, as we know them, arose in
Palestine after the conquest, by the subdivision and
regrouping of the invading clans, and their combination
with the Canaanites.</p>

<p>Cheyne and Winckler have lately advocated theories
which almost revolutionize the history of Israel. The
grounds of these theories are largely as follows: The
cuneiform inscriptions mention a kingdom of <i>Musri</i> in
Northwestern Arabia. For this reason, and for various
technical considerations of textual and historical criticism,
it is proposed in many passages to substitute <i>Musri</i> for
Egypt, <i>Geshur</i> for Assyria (Asshur) and to restore very
numerous references to <i>Jerahmeel</i>&mdash;according to our present
text an obscure tribe to the south of Palestine.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
such alternatives and resources at the critic's disposal,
history would seem to become anything that a taste or
fancy may dictate; so far these views<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> have not met with
much acceptance. In the later history the more recent developments
are chiefly concerned with the interval between
the Return and the Maccabees. Some time since Prof.
Kosters denied that the account of the Return in <i>Ezra</i>
was historical. According to him there was no Return
in 538 B. C., and the Temple was rebuilt by the remnant
of Jews left behind in Judea at the time of the Captivity.
Kosters has had many followers and many adverse critics,
but opinion inclines to accept the substantial historicity of
the account of the Return.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> It is also maintained that
various sections of <i>Ezra-Nehemiah</i> do not stand in correct
chronological order, and that the first mission of
Nehemiah preceded that of Ezra. Another interesting
discussion has arisen in connection with Zerubbabel,
Haggai, and Zechariah.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Zerubbabel is supposed, at
the instigation of Haggai and Zechariah, to have declared
Judah independent of Persia, and to have ascended the
throne as the promised Messiah. He was promptly
crushed and put to death by the Persian government, and&mdash;according
to this view&mdash;he is the "Servant of Jehovah"
whose fate is described in Isaiah LIII. There may be
a measure of truth in all this, but these views are not
likely to be adopted in their entirety.</p>

<p>Another important suggestion as to the history of
Israel after the Exile comes from Prof. Cheyne, following
to some extent in the footsteps of Robertson Smith
and earlier scholars. It is that the Jews took part in the
great rebellion against Artaxerxes III, Ochus <i>circa</i> B. C.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
350; that their rising was caused by religious enthusiasm,
and led to the desecration of the Temple. This calamity
is supposed to have been the occasion of the composition
of certain Psalms and other passages,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> which most
scholars either connect with the destruction of Jerusalem
by Nebuchadnezzar or refer to the Maccabean period.</p>

<p>The progress of the historical study of Old Testament
Theology is hindered by the lack of agreement, even
amongst scholars of the modern school, as to the date
of many important passages. It is impossible to write
certainly as to the teaching, for instance, of Isaiah and
Amos, or as to the stages of development of the Religion
of Israel while authorities of the first rank are divided
as to whether the Messianic sections in Isaiah and the
monotheistic verses in Amos were composed by those
prophets, or are post-exilic additions. Moreover there
is no immediate prospect of a settlement of these questions,
for the data are meagre and ambiguous, and the
grounds on which individual writers arrive at decisions
are largely subjective.</p>

<p>Nevertheless a great deal is clear and certain; and even
where dates are doubtful, much of the teaching is independent
of chronology. Within these limits the <i>Expositor's
Bible</i> and other works have done much to bring
popular theology into line with the results of larger
knowledge and fresh research and discussion. This
process has now reached a point which may enable
us to say with the Bishop of Winchester,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> "The period
of transition, the period of anxious suspense of judgment,
is drawing to a close. It is seen and felt that the
interpretation of Holy Scripture is not less literal, not
less spiritual, not less in conformity with the pattern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
which the Divine Teacher gave, when it is rendered more
true to history by the fiery tests of criticism and literary
analysis."</p>


<p class="center">VIII.&mdash;CONCLUSION.</p>

<p>This brief survey has necessarily been occupied for the
most part with the developments of recent research. But
in these years as in previous periods the Old Testament
has been the subject of much searching, preaching and
writing which has taken little or no account of changes
in criticism, or, indeed, of any criticism at all; but have
taken the narratives as they found them, and, as far as
authorship has been concerned, have made the assumptions
which seemed easiest and most edifying. Such
work, too, is most valuable. The spiritual life which
speaks to us through the Hebrew Scriptures is so full of
energy, variety, and truth that even the simplest methods
of treatment yield great results. These results, moreover,
have sometimes a special quality which is absent from
more studious exposition. Even after many centuries the
inspired books are like rich virgin soil which yield a harvest
even to the crudest methods of cultivation. Thus
the scribes of our day, instructed unto the Kingdom of
Heaven, are still bringing out of their treasures things
new and old; and both alike minister to the coming of the
Kingdom, both the new and the old, both the influence
of ancient association and venerable tradition, and the
new life and power and hope that spring to birth in dawning
light of a new day of the Lord.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>That the Old Testament will still hold its place of power
in any new dispensation is guaranteed by its significance
for Christ and His Gospel. As Prof. G. A. Smith has
said in a work which states the religious position in the
light of recent Biblical study,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Christ accepted the history
recorded in the Old Testament "as the preparation for
Himself, and taught His disciples to find Him in it. He
used it to justify His mission and to illuminate the
mystery of His Cross.... Above all, He fed His
own soul with its contents, and in the great crises of His
life sustained Himself upon it as upon the living and
sovereign Word of God. These are the highest external
proofs&mdash;if indeed we can call them external&mdash;for the
abiding validity of the Old Testament in the life and
doctrine of Christ's Church. What was indispensable to
the Redeemer must always be indispensable to the
redeemed."</p>

<h2>GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO THE<br />
EXPOSITOR'S BIBLE</h2>

<h3>NEW TESTAMENT</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Walter F. Adeney</span>, M. A.<br />

Professor of New Testament Exegesis at Lancashire College,<br />
Manchester</p>


<p class="center">I.&mdash;CHARACTERISTICS OF THE EXPOSITION</p>

<p>When we pass from the volumes of the Expositor's
Bible that deal with the Old Testament to those which
expound the books of the New Testament we discover
less departure from the traditional attitude. And yet
a very little knowledge of the enormous amount of
research which has been prosecuted during recent
years in the fruitful field of primitive Christian literature
and its surrounding scenes must convince us that
here also was a clamorous call for a fresh treatment
of the whole subject. It is much to have the
books taken one by one and treated each as a distinct
entity; in this way we are led on to perceive that richer
harmony of the various apostolic notes which means
so much more than the unison of the older methods:
First, instead of the familiar treatment of minute
phrases commonly known as "text," we have the wider
survey and broader handling of the arguments of the
books, which to those who have not been accustomed
to it appears as a revelation, so that these books become
new things to them. Then we have that individual
treatment, that temporary isolation of the books,
which enables us to understand their limitations as
well as the amplitude of their contents. Lastly, we
come to see the specific teaching of the several New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Testament writers, so that we can no longer confuse
the distinctive message of the author of <i>Hebrews</i> with
that of St. Paul, or confound the ideas of St. Peter with
those of St. James.</p>


<p class="center">II.&mdash;TEXT AND TRANSLATION</p>

<p>The Expositor's Bible is based upon a more accurate
text and more exact renderings of the New Testament
than were available for previous works of exposition.
The discovery of one of the two oldest known manuscripts
at the Monastery of St. Catharine on Mount
Sinai, in the middle of the nineteenth century, is only
one, though perhaps the greatest, of the steps in advance
towards obtaining a correct Greek Testament
which have been taken during the last hundred years.
The immense labors of Tischendorf in the collation of
manuscripts and readings from the Fathers, following
the earlier work of Mill, Griesbach and others, but with
a much richer mine of materials to draw upon, laid a
foundation on which later experts have been laboring
with the aim of producing the purest possible text.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
Westcott and Hort went further in working out a scientific
theory with canons of interpretation which at first
appeared to sweep the field and claim almost universal
assent.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> More recently, however, it has been felt that
these scholars were tempted to rely too much on one or
two old manuscripts&mdash;chiefly, indeed, on a single
manuscript, the Vatican, and to treat too contemptuously
the claims of what is known as the "Western
Text," represented among other authorities by the
great Cambridge MS., the <i>Codex Bezae</i>. Accordingly
their text cannot be regarded as final.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Meanwhile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
perhaps the soundest working Greek Testament
is that edited by Nestlè for the "British and Foreign
Bible Society," which strikes the mean of several
critical editions. The more accurate text has been
accompanied by more correct translations, of which
the most conspicuous are the English and American
Revised Versions. This may be described as substantially
one and the same revision of the so-called
"Authorized Version"; but there are several emendations
of the American revisers which were not accepted
by their more conservative English coadjutors,
although in nearly every case they must be allowed to
be improvements both as regards scholarship and also
in lucidity. Since the Revised Version appeared several
completely new translations of the New Testament
into modern English have been published.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>


<p class="center">III.&mdash;RECENT CRITICISM</p>

<p>The most remarkable characteristic of the latest
Biblical criticism is the application to the New Testament
of those disintegrating processes with the results
of which on Old Testament studies we have long been
familiar. This, however, is by no means so alarming
as the claims of the more radical critics might suggest.
It is true that some scholars carry their destructive
criticism to an extreme&mdash;for instance, Schmiedel with
the gospels, refusing to allow full assurance for the
authenticity of more than five of our Lord's sayings,
and Van Manen with the epistles, repudiating the
authenticity of all those ascribed to St. Paul.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> But these
critics stand almost alone; at all events they do not
represent anything like the normal position of New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Testament scholarship. The accident of their prominence
in one of the great Bible dictionaries, which is
simply due to editorial sympathies, must not disguise
the fact of their eccentricity. Nothing is more remarkable
in recent criticism than the fact that while
the more conservative of the two new dictionaries<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
accepts the main critical position of advanced scholarship
with regard to the Old Testament, it differs
<i>toto coelo</i><a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> from its rival in its treatment of the New Testament.
In these respects it fairly corresponds to the
position taken up by most of the writers of the Expositor's
Bible.</p>

<p>A remarkable approach towards unanimity is to be
seen in the views of scholars of various types with
reference to what is known as the "synoptic problem,"
the problem of the origin of our first three gospels
occasioned by the perplexing phenomena of their frequent
close resemblance and signally frequent striking
divergence. Fifty years ago opinions about this question
were in a perfectly chaotic condition; indeed, there were
about as many opinions as the highest possible arithmetical
variation in the mutual relations of the gospels
would permit. Some put Matthew first, some Mark,
some Luke; and all conceivable theories as to their relation
one to another, the use of earlier documents, and the
degree of reliance on tradition or on written sources to
be detected in their authors found eager advocates. But
gradually the turbid waters settled and certain definite,
generally accepted ideas were crystallized. In the present
day it is almost universally agreed that <i>Mark</i> was written
by the man whose name it bears, although when
Pfleiderer gave his adhesion to this view such a confession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
from one who was regarded as a leader of the "left
wing" of criticism occasioned some surprise.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Further,
it is the generally accepted opinion that the bulk of the
narrative portion of Matthew&mdash;the chief exceptions being
the Infancy and Resurrection narrative&mdash;is based on
Mark, and that the same is true to a considerable extent
with regard to <i>Luke</i>. There has been much discussion
as to whether St. Mark's gospel has undergone revision.
But the ripest results of study on this subject are represented
by the conclusions of Dr. Abbott who has shown
that our <i>Mark</i> is really the earlier edition of the gospel
which in a later and slightly modified form, its ruggedness
being smoothed, was used in the construction of
<i>Matthew</i> and <i>Luke</i>. In the second place, it is very generally
admitted that the discourses in <i>Matthew</i>, which
are inserted in five blocks of sayings, like five wedges
driven into the narrative as that stands in <i>Mark</i>, are the
contents of a work consisting of the "oracles," or "sacred
sayings," of Jesus which a very ancient church writer,
Papias the Bishop of Hierapolis, tells us that Matthew
compiled.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Thus we get two of our gospels well
authenticated, <i>Mark</i> being admitted to be the work of the
man to whom it is ascribed and <i>Matthew</i> being acknowledged
as in the main a combination of St. Matthew the
Apostle's collection of the teachings of Jesus with the
standard narrative in <i>Mark</i>. The infancy and resurrection
narratives must have been derived from other primitive
authorities.</p>

<p>The case of our third gospel is somewhat different. As
we might expect from his preface, St. Luke has availed
himself of a wider range of materials. But he too, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the author of our first gospel, is now admitted to have
used <i>Mark</i> as his primary basis, though not to so great
extent, or so almost exclusively. In particular in that rich
section which is commonly, though perhaps erroneously,
ascribed to our Lord s Peræan ministry, he has a store of
precious materials that are not met with in any other gospels.
Similarly, while some verbal coincidences lead us to
the conclusion that he also used St. Matthew's collection
of the sayings of Jesus, it is evident that he had other
collections of our Lord's teachings, from which, for
instance, he got the parables of the Prodigal Son and of
the Good Samaritan, and many other choice utterances the
characteristic beauty and originality of which constitute
their own authentication.</p>

<p>Turning to the Fourth Gospel, we see that this wonderful
book has been subjected to the most searching criticism
during recent years with very interesting results.
Half a century ago Baur declared that it could not have
been written before the Year A. D. 160. Since then the
finding of primitive Christian Documents<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> which bear
testimony to the use of this gospel in earlier times,
together with the proofs of its archaic character brought
out by a comparison of its contents with second-century
literature, has forced the date of its origin steadily back
and yet further back, till the latest possible date that can
be assigned to it is quite early in the second century.
But more than this, there is a growing tendency to connect
this gospel with the son of Zebedee. Some scholars<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
would assign the actual writing of the book to another
person, perhaps John the Elder; but then they allow that
this somewhat shadowy personage, referred to by Papias
as a contemporary of the Apostles, derived his information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
from the Beloved Disciple. One leading scholar<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
holds that the teachings of Jesus in our Fourth Gospel
came from the Apostle John, while he thinks that most
of the narrative portions are due to another hand. But
in one of the latest works on the subject, Dr. Drummond
ascribes the whole book to the Apostle and meets the
adverse views of recent criticism with masterly replies.
Even if the final verdict should be to ascribe the literary
form of the work to John the Elder or some unknown
scholar at Ephesus, the growing consensus of opinion is
toward assigning the substance of it to St. John himself.</p>

<p>The same period has seen a reasonable change in the
critical treatment of the <i>Acts of the Apostles</i>. The
"Tübingen School," represented in this case especially
by Zeller, the author of well-known works on Greek
philosophy, had treated the book as altogether a fancy
picture of early church history designed to reconcile the
two opposite parties of St. Paul and the elder Apostles
by means of the compromise of Catholicism. That theory
is now extinct, and recent research has gone a long way
to vindicate the trustworthiness of the book, partly by
showing the primitive character of the first half&mdash;especially
as illustrated by the speeches of St. Peter and
others,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> and later by the collection of many evidences of
the historicity of the second portion of the book, namely,
that containing the missionary journeys of St. Paul. We
owe it especially to the brilliant studies of Prof. Ramsay&mdash;the
greatest living authority on the antiquities and
history of Asia Minor in the first century&mdash;that many
local and contemporary facts have been brought to light
confirmatory of the accuracy of St. Luke as a historian.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p><p>With regard to St. Paul's epistles the case stands thus:
A few extremists reject them all, partly on the ground
of their supposed inconsistency with the <i>Acts</i>&mdash;thus
reversing Zeller's argument, but mainly because of the
advanced condition of Christian experience which they
illustrate, as though the pace of spiritual development in
the white heat of the greatest religious "revival" the
world has ever seen could be measured by the ideas of a
Dutch professor in his chill lecture room! But the mass
of critical opinion&mdash;British, German, and American&mdash;is
tending toward a wider recognition of the genuineness of
these writings than was allowed a generation ago. Baur's
admittedly authentic group of four, which has been called
"the great quadrilateral of Christianity," still stands&mdash;viz.,
<i>1 and 2 Corinthians</i>, <i>Galatians</i> and <i>Romans</i>. Next come
<i>Philippians</i> and <i>I Thessalonians</i> now accepted as virtually
beyond question. Then <i>Colossians</i> has been vindicated in
schools of severe criticism.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> If <i>Colossians</i> is allowed,
there can be no doubt as to receiving its companion
epistle, the beautiful little letter to Philemon. There are
still many who are unable to admit <i>2 Thessalonians</i>,
chiefly because of its apocalyptic contents. But of late
years it has been shown that the primitive church was
possessed with the hope of the coming of Christ
in glory to a remarkable extent, as a perfectly
dominating idea. There remains <i>Ephesians</i> as now
the most questioned of all the epistles that bear the
name of St. Paul, except the Pastorals. But when it is
seen that one of the chief objections to it is that it is said
to be "a <i>weak</i>" (!) imitation of <i>Colossians</i> we may be
allowed to regard this judgment as a matter of personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
taste rather than a decision of objective criticism.
Luther does not stand alone in holding this epistle to be
one of the choicest books of the New Testament.</p>

<p>The question of the <i>Pastoral Epistles</i> must be considered
as still one meeting with doubtful answers. Many
scholars who accept all the ten epistles of St. Paul to the
Churches agree with Marcion of the second century in
not admitting these three works. Still they are defended
by most British and American New Testament<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> scholars,
and some who do not allow that in their present form
they can be attributed to the Apostle still admit that they
contain fragments of the Apostle's genuine writings.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Epistle to the Hebrews</i> is now universally admitted
not to be a work of St. Paul. The book itself makes
no claim to be such, and it is unfortunate that the English
Revisers retained the misleading title ascribing it to
"Paul the Apostle," a late superscription of no historical
value. Happily the American Revisers have struck this
out. Claims for Barnabas and for Apollos as its author
have their advocates; and lately Prof. Harnach has
hit on the happy guess, backed up by considerations of
some amount of probability, that its author was a woman&mdash;Priscilla.
But most scholars feel it necessary to abide
by Origen's negative conclusion: "Who wrote the epistle
God only knows." That it is a most valuable work of
high inspiration well worthy of a place in the canon in
spite of its anonymity cannot be doubted. It has recently
received special attention from scholars in the form of
fresh and luminous exposition.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>
<p><i>I Peter</i> has been somewhat severely handled in recent
times, Harnach regarding it as the work of some unknown
disciple of St. Paul. But the growing perception
of a <i>rapprochement</i> between the two great Apostles, which
is seen in recent scholarship, points to the conclusion that
St. Peter, who was evidently a man of a most impressionable
nature, may not have felt himself above receiving
influences from the great Apostle of the Gentiles; and it is
not to be denied that there are features of the epistle
which link it more closely with St. Peter's speeches in
Acts than with the writings of St. Paul. On the other
hand <i>2 Peter</i> is the one book of the New Testament now
almost universally treated as not genuine; it was the
latest to be accepted in the primitive church.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p><i>James</i> is regarded as a genuine work of the head of the
Church at Jerusalem by its chief English commentator,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
although most German and American scholars who have
written about it recently assign it to a very late date.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Epistles of John</i> are now almost universally
admitted to be the work of the author of the fourth
gospel. Little can be said as to the <i>Epistle of Jude</i>
except that its free use of Apocryphal books has been
clearly demonstrated. But, lastly, a flood of light has
been thrown on the <i>Revelation</i> by recent studies in
Jewish Apocalyptic literature, and even in Babylonian
mythology.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> It has been shown that this mysterious
book, which many had regarded as unique in literature,
may be associated with a school of Jewish and
Christian Apocalyptic writings from some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
former of which it draws its materials. Then, as the
inquiry is pushed further back, some of the most remarkable
imagery is traced through these Jewish
writings to Babylonian legends. While this interesting
process may help to account for the form of the
book, it does not touch its essence and that marvelous
inspiration by virtue of which it soars above all possible
rivals and it is to us <i>the</i> Apocalypt, the one book in
which the Spirit of God unveils the springs and purposes
of the providence of history.</p>


<p class="center">IV.&mdash;EXEGESIS</p>

<p>During recent years the methods of the commentator
have undergone almost as great a revolution as
those of the critic. New dictionaries and grammars<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
have helped to a more accurate understanding of words
and phrases. But the most remarkable contribution
to this form of study comes from a wholly new region,
the region of contemporary records. Inscriptions in
Greece and Asia Minor and <i>Papyri</i> discovered in
Egypt, dating from the very time when the New Testament
was written, are found to contain phrases
identical with what we had been accustomed to regard
as peculiarly characteristic of Hellenistic or New Testament
Greek. The conclusion to be drawn from
these remarkable discoveries is that the books of the
New Testament were written in the ordinary spoken
Greek of their day, the very same form of language in
which leases were drawn up and private letters were
written by people at Oxyrhynchus in Egypt, in which
inscriptions were chiseled by sculptors in Cos among
the isles of Greece. From this we are led to see the
mistake of the old commentators in interpreting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
New Testament by means of their knowledge of the
classics. The consequence is that the Revised Version
must be regarded as already partially out of date, since
its committees were dominated by English university
classical scholarship, as represented by Dr. Ellicott,
the chairman of the English committee.</p>

<p>Another modern movement of research also carries
us away from the old classicism. While the New
Testament writers used the colloquial language of the
cosmopolitan Greek-speaking people of their day, they
were all, or nearly all, brought up in Jewish schools
and taught to think in Jewish modes of thought. This
indicates that some of their expressions can best be
interpreted by a knowledge of Aramaic, the language
of Palestine in the time of Christ. And now Aramaic
studies have been brought in to assist in the interpretation
of the New Testament with luminous results.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Two further characteristics may be observed in the
new modern commentaries.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> One is a vigorous effort
to arrive at the original meaning of the books, rather than
to the exclusion of any reference to theological systems
of later date; in other words, honest exegesis, rather
than polemical discussion. The other characteristic
is a broader method of treatment in seeking for the
ideas of the sacred writings as more important than
the minute study of words which characterized the
scholarship of the last generation of commentators.
The older commentaries were mainly grammatical;
the newer commentaries are chiefly historical, theological
or philosophical.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> In harmony with this later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
method of exegesis the Expositor's Bible may be regarded
as a great commentary on the Holy Scriptures,
as well as a work of exposition.</p>


<p class="center">V.&mdash;CONTEMPORANEOUS HISTORY AND THOUGHT</p>

<p>It is no longer possible for the fully equipped scribe
who is to bring out of his treasury things new and old
to be "a man of one book." While the center of his
studies must be the Scriptures, he has undertaken to
explain, his very explanation of them is largely dependent
on his gleanings from other fields of learning.
Formerly the Bible was regarded by itself in dazzling
isolation, like a statue set on a pedestal. Now we
discover that we can see it much better when it stands
in its place, which is not a mere niche in the wall of
the temple of humanity, but the central shrine of all
history. The life and thought of the world in which
the New Testament first appeared must not be treated
as the mere frame of the picture, although even that
would be something, for a suitable frame helps to show
its contents to the best advantage. But we should
rather think of the circumstances and setting of the
gospel and apostolic stories as background and even
in part foreground to the Christian revelation. It
must be confessed that sometimes these accessories
are painted with so much Pre-raffaelite force and
color that there is a danger of missing the message of
the picture owing to the distraction of the accessories.
A knowledge of the geography of Palestine, Eastern
manners and customs, the state of the Roman world at
the time of Christ, contemporary Greek philosophy,
and a host of other matters more or less remote from
the central theme of the New Testament, must not be
allowed to overshadow that central theme. The picturesqueness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of modern writing threatens this danger;
and modern writing is nothing if it is not picturesque.
But true illustration, such as is aimed at in the Expositor's
Bible, goes deeper. It does not detract from the
interest of the New Testament itself by the meretricious
charms of the surroundings, a materializing
and secularizing of the sacred and spiritual of which
some of the most popular modern Lives of Christ are
guilty. On the contrary, it seeks to throw light on
the New Testament itself, explaining obscurities, vivifying
what had not been fully realized before, setting
the whole picture before us in warm colors of life.
Used in this way the fruits of the <i>Palestine Exploration
Fund</i> prove to be of great value. Then scholars of contemporary
Jewish life and thought have enabled
us to see more clearly the actual condition of the people
among whom Jesus lived,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> and those who have been
investigating the history and archæology of the Roman
Empire of this period have enabled us to see much
more clearly, how the Apostles carried out their wider
mission, how the first churches were founded in the
larger world, and how the primitive Christian life was
lived in the midst of pagan surroundings.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>


<p class="center">VI.&mdash;LIFE AND HISTORY OF THE EARLY CHURCH</p>

<p>Making use of such materials as have been indicated
above, several scholars have been attempting the
difficult task of writing the Life of Christ,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and several
also the more manageable work of giving an account
of the history of Apostolic times. Here we see that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the destructive criticism which made havoc of history
under the hands of the famous "Tübingen school" has
been almost entirely superseded by constructive efforts
which have brought out the circumstances of primitive
times with remarkable clearness. The learned, sober
studies of Hort in England,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>, as well as the writings of
Prof. Ramsay already referred to; the brilliant
work of Weizsäcker<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> in Germany; the histories of
McGiffert,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> of the school of Harnach, and of Prof.
Bartlet, a singularly judicious and discerning writer,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
are among the most prominent contributions to a right
understanding of the events of the Apostolic times.
Indeed, it is not too much to say that the research and
criticism of recent days have brought us face to face
with the primitive age of Christianity in a manner
never attainable during any of the intermediate ages.
It is as though we of the twentieth century had gained
a height from which we could look across the intervening
centuries, many of which lie wrapped in mist,
and see clear and sharp against the horizon the blue
hills of the wonderful first century.</p>


<p class="center">VII.&mdash;NEW TESTAMENT THEOLOGY</p>

<p>Of all the contributions to the study of the Scriptures
with which research, scholarship and thought have
enriched our age, none are more fruitful than those which
belong to the province of Biblical Theology. Strange
as it may appear, while the Bible has been the final
authority appealed to in the teaching of dogmatic
Theology all down the ages, Biblical Theology is a new
science, undreamed of by all but comparatively recent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
scholars. The old method was to start with a proposition,
a thesis, a dogma, and then hunt through the Bible
for proof texts. This was the method of the one
supremely great work in Systematic Theology which
Protestantism has produced&mdash;Calvin's <i>Institutes</i>. The
great reformer first states his dogma and then proceeds
to marshal texts in proof of it, following this process by
a refutation of objections and an explaining away of
apparently adverse texts. You can prove anything in
that way. This vicious method accounts for the fact that
all the wildest heresies and extravagances of fanaticism,
as well as all the great mutually opposed systems of
Divinity that have appeared in Christendom, have been
able to appeal triumphantly to Scripture in proof of their
contentions. Such a confusion of results should have
been accepted as the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of the method.</p>

<p>But now the new process of the study of Biblical
Theology follows a more modest but more scientific
method. It does not start with any dogma which it seeks
to prove; it even dispenses with the "working hypothesis"
which science admits to be legitimate. It is wholly inductive.
Its aim is simply to discover what the Scriptures
teach, no matter whether this should turn out to be
favorable to preconceived notions or the reverse. In
pursuit of this object it seeks to divest the mind of a mass
of irrelevant and distracting notions, the accumulation of
ages of Christian thinking and controversy, and work its
way back to the times in which the several books were
written, viewing them in the atmosphere of their origin.
It approaches each book rather from what went before
than from what came after, seeing that a thing is usually
conditioned by its antecedents, but never by its sequels.
Then it segregates the writings of each school or class of
teachers, and further the specific teaching of each writer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Lastly, it endeavors to discover the teaching of each book
in its entirety and also in its individuality. These points
were touched upon in the opening of this section of the
Introduction; they need to be treated rather more
explicitly before we close because they enter into the
more valuable characteristics of the Expositor's Bible.</p>

<p>The application of this new method of Biblical
Theology to the New Testament has been delightfully
fruitful in results. First and foremost come the studies
in the teachings of Jesus with which the Christian thought
of our age has been revivified. The now familiar phrase
"back to Christ" has been nowhere better illustrated than
in the course of these studies. It has now become possible
to know to a considerable extent what was the actual
teaching of the Master detached from the subsequent
teaching of the disciples; and such knowledge must be
welcomed as of supreme importance even if we allow that
the disciples were authorized and inspired teachers commissioned
by Christ Himself to carry on the revelation
of Christian truth by means of the illumination of the
Holy Spirit with which they were endowed. Every loyal
servant of Christ must attach primary importance to the
position, the action, the sufferings and the very words
of his Lord and Master. The teachings of Jesus form
the most valuable part of every book that deals at all
adequately with New Testament Theology as a whole;<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
but they are also discussed in works wholly devoted to
this great subject.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> One interesting report which has been
brought out with peculiar force both by Beyschlag and
by Wendt is the essential harmony between our Lord's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
teaching in the synoptic gospels and that in John. Special
attention has lately been given the teaching of Christ
about Himself, and in particular to the meaning of the
title, "the Son of Man."<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> There has also been much discussion
about the teaching of Jesus in the gospels concerning
the last things, and Dr. Charles, the greatest
authority on this subject, has set forth the view that
Jewish eschatological notions are here blended with the
original teachings of Jesus, while others think that our
Lord's teachings about the Destruction of Jerusalem have
been confused with His teachings about the end of the
world and the final judgment.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>The teachings of St. Paul, the greatest theologian of
the primitive church, and indeed of all ages, have received
searching investigation during recent years. They are
discussed with much fullness in the books on New Testament
Theology as a whole that have been already referred
to; and valuable works have been devoted to the exclusive
study of them. The prejudiced views of Baur having
been to a great extent demolished, Pfleiderer, also of
"the left wing" of criticism, produced a powerful work,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
in which the ideas of the Apostle were subjected to a keen
but not very sympathetic analysis. August Sabatier<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
contributed a brilliant study to the development of the
ideas of the Apostle in the course of his writings which
were taken in historical order; and he was followed by
the more cautious exposition of Prof. Stevens.
Other extremely useful writings on this most fruitful
theme have appeared from time to time, as well as special
monographs of Johannine Theology.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p><p>The result of all these studies is that we have now a
storehouse of collected information concerning the
specific teachings of the several parts of the New Testament,
such as no scholarship of previous ages had
attempted, because the historical method on which it is
all based was not practised until recently. Much of this
storehouse was at the disposal of the writers of the
Expositor's Bible, and many of its treasures will be
found in their volumes, while perhaps it is not too much
to hope that these volumes themselves will be welcomed
as valuable original contributions to the same supremely
important study&mdash;the study of the mind of Christ and the
thought of His Apostles.</p>

<p>The value of work like that which follows requires no
argument to prove its worth. An unindexed book is like
an unexplored continent. It may contain streams of
thought which might be sources of power if known. Diamonds
and gold may there be hidden away. The index is
the explorer's chart to the undiscovered country. The
great stores of a work like The Expositor's Bible are
not realized until they are tabulated in an index. The
chemistry of thought has produced many a gem for this
great work. This index will show where they are. The
compiler has endeavored to make a complete, comprehensive,
and practical index to this series. The index is
by subjects, texts, and authors quoted.</p>

<p>It has given me great pleasure to know in this intimate
way what The Expositor's Bible contains. If
this work shall help others to the same knowledge, the
labor involved is worth while.</p>

<h2>HOW TO USE THE INDEX</h2>


<p>As an illustration of the method by which to use the
subject index, take the first topic, Aaron. The reference
to Aaron and his sons will be found in the volume
"Numbers" of The Expositor's Bible, page 32.</p>

<p>A good illustration of the way to use the textual part
of the index is found in John XVII, 19. Of course the
main treatment will be found in its proper place in Vol.
II of the Gospel of John by Dr. Dods; but we find a reference
in the volume on Leviticus, page 57; in that containing
Ephesians, page 369; in that on the Epistles of
Peter, page 151. The reader will find that these will aid
in acquiring a more complete understanding of the text
studied. The inter-relation of the Old and New Testaments
will be the better noted. It has been thought that
less trouble will be caused the reader by having the texts
included with the subjects under one index.</p>

<p>Where a book of the Bible is contained in more than
one volume, although possibly bound, the two volumes in
one, the reference, for example, under Acts VII, verse
49, to Isaiah II, 287, would be found on page 287 of the
second volume of Isaiah.</p>

<p>"The exposition is original, full of life, striking, and relevant. He has given
us the fruit of much careful thought, and all students of the New Testament
and preachers of the Gospel will be grateful to him. This is, in short, an
unusually good book."&mdash;<i>British Weekly.</i></p>

<blockquote><p>By the <b>Rev. ALEXANDER MACLAREN, D.D., D.Lit.</b></p></blockquote>

<p>"In nothing Dr. Maclaren has written is there more of beauty, of spiritual
insight, or of brilliant elucidation of Scripture. Indeed, Dr. Maclaren is here
at his best."&mdash;<i>Expositor.</i></p>

<p>"It contains a wealth of thought for preachers."&mdash;<i>Rock.</i></p>

<p>"Dr. Maclaren's exposition is remarkable for vigour and common sense. It
is strongly written, and arranged with scholarly thoroughness."&mdash;<i>Academy.</i></p>


<p><b>The Book of Genesis</b></p>

<blockquote><p>By the <b>Rev. Prof. MARCUS DODS, D.D.</b></p></blockquote>

<p>"Every reader of cultured mind and delicate instinct will recognise with
delight and admire the fine qualities of sympathetic insight, sensitive perception,
ethical intuition, and religious tact."&mdash;<i>The late</i> <span class="smcap">Prof. W. G. Elmslie</span>, M.A.</p>


<p><b>The First Book of Samuel</b></p>

<blockquote><p>By the <b>Rev. Prof. W. G. BLAIKIE, D.D., LL.D.</b></p></blockquote>

<p>"Remarkably interesting and helpful. Very seldom have we met with a
religious work which we can more confidently recommend for its thoughtfulness,
fidelity, and kindly spirit."&mdash;<i>Leeds Mercury.</i></p>


<p><b>The Second Book of Samuel</b></p>

<blockquote><p>By the <b>Rev. Prof. W. G. BLAIKIE, D.D., LL.D.</b></p></blockquote>

<p>"There can be no doubt of the care and thoroughness with which Dr. Blaikie
has executed his task. From his own point of view he has produced a solid and
able piece of work."&mdash;<i>Academy.</i></p>

<blockquote><p>By the <b>Rev. Principal T. C. EDWARDS, D.D.</b>, Author of
"A Commentary on the First Epistle to the Corinthians."</p></blockquote>

<p>"He has entered into the spirit and purport of what truly he calls 'one of
the greatest and most difficult books of the New Testament' with a systematic
thoroughness and fairness which cannot be too highly commended."&mdash;<i>Academy.</i></p>

<p>"There is abundant evidence of accurate scholarship, acute criticism, patient
thought, and faculty of lucid exposition. However thoroughly any one has
studied the Epistle here explained, he will certainly find in Dr. Edwards's
volume fresh suggestions."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. Marcus Dods.</span></p>

<p><b>The Epistle to the Galatians</b></p>

<blockquote><p>By the <b>Rev. Prof. G. G. FINDLAY, D.D.</b>, Headingley
College, Leeds.</p></blockquote>

<p>"In this volume we have the mature results of broad and accurate scholarship,
exegetical tact, and a firm grasp of the great principles underlying the
Gospel of Paul presented in a form so lucid and attractive that every thoughtful
reader can enjoy it."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Professor Beet.</span></p>


<p><b>The Book of Isaiah Chapters I.-XXXIX.</b></p>

<p>By the <b>Rev. Prof. G. ADAM SMITH, M.A., D.D.</b></p>

<p>"This is a very attractive book. Mr. George Adam Smith has evidently
such a mastery of the scholarship of his subject that it would be a sheer impertinence
for most scholars, even though tolerable Hebraists, to criticise his
translations; and certainly it is not the intention of the present reviewer to
attempt anything of the kind, to do which he is absolutely incompetent. All
we desire is to let English readers know how very lucid, impressive&mdash;and,
indeed, how vivid&mdash;a study of Isaiah is within their reach; the fault of the book,
if it has a fault, being rather that it finds too many points of connection between
Isaiah and our modern world, than that it finds too few. In other words, no
one can say that the book is not full of life."&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p>


<p><b>The Pastoral Epistles</b></p>

<blockquote><p>By the <b>Rev. ALFRED PLUMMER, D.D.</b>, Master of University
College, Durham.</p></blockquote>

<p>"An admirable sample of what popular theology ought to be."&mdash;<i>Saturday
Review.</i></p>

<p>"The treatment is throughout scholarlike, lucid, thoughtful."&mdash;<i>Guardian.</i></p>


<p><b>The First Epistle to the Corinthians</b></p>

<blockquote><p>By the <b>Rev. Prof. MARCUS DODS, D.D.</b></p></blockquote>

<p>"A clear, close, unaffected, unostentatious exposition, not verse by verse,
but thought after thought, of this most interesting perhaps, and certainly most
various, of all the Apostle's writings."&mdash;<i>London Quarterly Review.</i></p>


<p><b>The Epistles of St. John</b></p>

<blockquote><p>By the <b>Most Rev. W. ALEXANDER, D.D.</b>; Lord Archbishop
of Armagh.</p></blockquote>

<p>"These commentaries are explicitly intended to help the preacher, and in
Dr. Alexander's 'Discourses' they will find material ready shaped to their
hand&mdash;not facts only, but imagery, references, and allusions, none of them
cheap or commonplace, and some of them felicitous in a high degree."&mdash;<i>Guardian.</i></p>


<p><b>The Revelation of St. John</b></p>

<blockquote><p>By the <b>Rev. Prof. W. MILLIGAN, D.D.</b>, of the University
of Aberdeen.</p></blockquote>

<p>"Lucid, scholarly."&mdash;<i>Academy.</i></p>

<p>"The style is admirably lucid, expressive, and withal stately. The task of
the reader could not possibly be easier, and in the case of such an abstruse
theme the result is no small feat of intellectual and literary ingenuity."&mdash;<i>Aberdeen
Free Press.</i></p>

<h2>Third Series.</h2>

<h3><i>Subscription Price,</i> 24s. <i>Separate Volumes,</i> 7s. 6d. <i>each.</i></h3>


<p><b>Judges and Ruth</b></p>

<blockquote><p>By the <b>Rev. R. A. WATSON, D.D.</b></p></blockquote>

<p>"This volume deals chiefly with a book considered by some one of the most
difficult of expositions from a Christian point of view. While feeling this to be
the case, the writer is able to deduce valuable instruction from the history by
the only legitimate mode, that of remembering that the character and laws of
God are essentially unchangeable, though the amount of their revelation must
vary with the capacity of those who receive it.... The moralisings on the
Book of Ruth are also most excellent, and just what are adapted to present
circumstances."&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p>


<p><b>The Prophecies of Jeremiah</b></p>

<p>With a Sketch of his Life and Times.</p>

<p>By the <b>Rev. C. J. BALL, M.A.</b>, Chaplain of Lincoln's Inn.</p>

<p>"Mr. Ball brings competent knowledge to his task.... A useful running
commentary."&mdash;<i>Saturday Review.</i></p>

<p>"It consists of an interesting and sympathetic delineation of the prophet's
life and character, of a new translation, and of expository remarks, which are
partly critical and partly homiletic. The critical portion will be prized most, as
it exhibits deep learning, breadth of view, and clear insight into the prophet's
meaning."&mdash;<i>Manchester Examiner.</i></p>


<p><b>The Book of Exodus</b></p>

<blockquote><p>By the <b>Right Rev. G. A. CHADWICK, D.D.</b>, Lord Bishop of
Derry and Raphoe.</p></blockquote>

<p>"Marked by sound exegesis, common sense, and a devotional spirit."&mdash;<i>Record.</i></p>

<p>"Every part of the book is replete with instruction and interest, and a unity
of thought and purpose pervades it all."&mdash;<i>Glasgow Herald.</i></p>


<p><b>The Gospel of St. Matthew</b></p>

<p>By the <b>Rev. J. MONRO GIBSON, D.D.</b>, Author of "The
Ages before Moses," etc.</p>

<p>"A careful exposition in which one important part is not slightly dealt with
while disproportionate space is given to another, but by studied economy of
labour and space due care and labour are given to every part. The exposition
is sober, reverent, and systematic; it is also enlightened and well informed."&mdash;<i>London
Quarterly Review.</i></p>


<p><b>The Gospel of St. Luke</b></p>

<blockquote><p>By the <b>Rev. HENRY BURTON, M.A.</b></p></blockquote>

<p>"Full of vivid illustration and fresh, bright exposition."&mdash;<i>Record.</i></p>

<p>"In the unfolding of truth Mr. Burton writes as a poet. There is glow and
colour and melody in his descriptions. Often there are passages of great
beauty."&mdash;<i>Methodist Recorder.</i></p>


<p><b>The Book of Isaiah Chapters XL. to LXVI.</b></p>

<blockquote><p>By the <b>Rev. Prof. G. ADAM SMITH, M.A., D.D.</b></p></blockquote>

<p>"A work of no ordinary merit; indeed, it is but rare that such exegetical
power and mature scholarship are united with an ease of style and a fertility of
modern illustration that leave but little to desire."&mdash;<i>Speaker.</i></p>

<h3><i>Subscription Price,</i> 24s. <i>Separate Volumes,</i> 7s. 6d. <i>each.</i></h3>


<p><b>The Gospel of St. John. Vol. I.</b></p>

<p>By the <b>Rev. Prof. MARCUS DODS, D.D.</b></p>

<p>"Dr. Dods' exposition, besides being characterised by all the literary grace
by which his previous works are distinguished, is also thoroughly evangelical in
tone, without, however, being at all narrow; while the arguments which this
portion of Scripture so powerfully suggests in proof of the divinity of Christ
are handled in such a way as will carry them home to all who accept the narrative
as authentic."&mdash;<i>Scotsman.</i></p>


<p><b>The Acts of the Apostles. Vol. I.</b></p>

<p>By the <b>Rev. Prof. G. T. STOKES, D.D.</b></p>

<p>"One of the most valuable contributions to the history of the Primitive
Church that have appeared within recent years."&mdash;<i>Dundee Advertiser.</i></p>


<p><b>The Book of Leviticus</b></p>

<p>By the <b>Rev. S. H. KELLOGG, D.D.</b></p>

<p>"The relation of law and gospel is grandly exhibited, and a difficult portion
of Holy Writ explained in detail and with power."&mdash;<i>Christian.</i></p>

<p>"He has certainly succeeded in investing with fresh interest this old book of
laws."&mdash;<i>Scotsman.</i></p>


<p><b>The Book of Proverbs</b></p>

<p>By the <b>Rev. R. F. HORTON, M.A., D.D.</b></p>

<p>"Ably and freshly written."&mdash;<i>Church Times.</i></p>

<p>"A book which may be read by all with pleasure and profit, and which, by
ministers of all orders, may be taken as a model of one kind of expository
teaching."&mdash;<i>Christian World.</i></p>

<p>"The expositor has done his work in a most masterly fashion."&mdash;<i>Glasgow
Herald.</i></p>


<p><b>The Epistles of St. James and St. Jude</b></p>

<p>By the <b>Rev. A. PLUMMER, D.D.</b>, Master of University
College, Durham.</p>

<p>"It is even a better piece of work than his former volume on the Pastoral
Epistles. It contains everything that the student can desire by way of introduction
to the two Epistles, while for those who read with an eye to the manufacture
of sermons, or for their own edification, the doctrinal and moral lessons
are developed in a style redolent of books, yet singularly easy and unaffected.
Points of interest abound."&mdash;<i>Saturday Review.</i></p>

<p>"A very able and interesting exposition.... An excellent example of
Scriptural exegesis."&mdash;<i>Academy.</i></p>


<p><b>The Book of Ecclesiastes
With a New Translation.</b></p>

<p>By the <b>Rev. SAMUEL COX, D.D.</b></p>

<p>"The most luminous, original, and practical exposition of Ecclesiastes which
is within the reach of ordinary English readers."&mdash;<i>Speaker.</i></p>

<p>"Dr. Cox's work is likely to count as one of the most interesting of the many
interesting studies of which Ecclesiastes has been the basis."&mdash;<i>Guardian.</i></p>

<p><b>The Epistles to the Thessalonians</b></p>

<p>By the <b>Rev. Prof. JAMES DENNEY. D.D.</b></p>

<p>"As an expositor we are able to say that Mr. Denney seems to have entered
very fully into the spirit of the Apostle Paul, and to have succeeded in expressing
very clearly, and impressing very forcibly, the general meaning of the Apostle's
words.... It is a very ably written work, and one which is well calculated to
make the Apostle's teaching in these two epistles more intelligible and more
telling."&mdash;<i>Scotsman.</i></p>


<p><b>The Book of Job</b></p>

<blockquote><p>By the <b>Rev. R. A. WATSON, D.D.</b>, Author of "Gospels
of Yesterday," etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>"Dr. Watson does not fall behind his predecessors in doing justice to this
magnificent effort of Hebrew genius or inspiration. The opening scene on
earth and the opening scene in heaven are brought before us with graphic
power, and the problem raised by the situation of Job by the unmerited
suffering of the good man stated and discussed with much force and philosophical
insight. Dr. Watson has written with conspicuous ability and a
thorough mastery of his subject."&mdash;<i>Scotsman.</i></p>


<p><b>The Gospel of St. John. Vol. II.</b></p>

<p>By <b>Prof. MARCUS DODS, D.D.</b></p>

<p>"Dr. Dods appears to us always to write with clearness and vigour.... He
has the gift of lucid expression, and by means of apt illustrations he avoids the
cardinal sin of dryness, so that the interest even of the general reader will not
flag as he smoothly glides through these chapters."&mdash;<i>Guardian.</i></p>


<p><b>The Epistle to the Ephesians</b></p>

<p>By the <b>Rev. Prof. G. G. FINDLAY, B.A. D.D.</b></p>

<p>"Every page shows that he has made a minute and careful examination of
the text, while in every chapter there are inferences drawn and suggestions
thrown out which will find their way into many sermons. They who know
this Epistle best will be the first to acknowledge the value of Prof. Findlay's
exposition."&mdash;<i>Expositor.</i></p>


<p><b>The Acts of the Apostles. Vol. II.</b></p>

<p>By the <b>Rev. Prof. G. T. Stokes, D.D.</b></p>

<p>"The second volume is as readable as the first, full of learning without a

sobriety, and manly piety."&mdash;<i>Saturday Review.</i></p>


<p><b>The Psalms. Vol. I.</b></p>

<p>By the <b>Rev. ALEXANDER MACLAREN, D.D., D.Lit.</b></p>

<p>"Dr. Maclaren has evidently mastered his subject with the aid of the best
authorities, and has put the results of his studies before his readers in a most
attractive form; and if we add that his commentary really helps to the better
understanding of the Psalms, that, far from degrading, it vivifies and illuminates
these sublime stories, and that it is written in a charming style, very seldom
falling below the dignity of the subject, we believe we only give it the praise
which is its due."&mdash;<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

<p><b>The Epistle to the Philippians</b></p>

<p>By the <b>Rev. Principal RAINY, D.D.</b></p>

<p>"A piece of good and thorough work, the work of a sound and well-read
expositor, and especially of an orthodox Scotch divine."&mdash;<i>London Quarterly
Review.</i></p>


<p><b>The First Book of Kings</b></p>

<blockquote><p>By the <b>Very Rev. F. W. FARRAR, D.D. F.R.S.</b>, Dean of
Canterbury.</p></blockquote>

<p>"Dr. Farrar brings his versatile literary powers to bear upon these majestic
and imposing scenes, with all his gifts of poetic description, his wealth of
quotations, and his aptitude for picturesque comparisons."&mdash;<i>Guardian.</i></p>


<p><b>Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther</b></p>

<p>By the <b>Rev. Prof. W. F. ADENEY, M.A.</b></p>

<p>"Mr. Adeney has evidently grasped the whole story with clearness and
force: his portraits are lifelike; he has all the instinct of the expositor in high
development. It is no small triumph to have done so well with one of the least
pictorial and fascinating of Old Testament histories."&mdash;<i>Independent.</i></p>


<p><b>The Book of Joshua</b></p>

<p>By the <b>Rev. Prof. W. G. BLAIKIE, D.D., LL.D.</b></p>

<p>"We have no hesitation in saying that for every-day working purposes
expositors of the Book of Joshua will find this volume more helpful than many
more critical and modernised works.... His expositions are usually fresh and
interesting, and there is an eye for the practical in all he writes."&mdash;<i>Glasgow
Herald.</i></p>


<p><b>The Psalms. Vol. II.</b></p>

<p>By the <b>Rev. ALEXANDER MACLAREN, D.D., D.Lit.</b></p>

<p>"The volume is as attractive as the first, and shows throughout the same
high qualities of penetration and spiritual sympathy. Its pages give abundant
evidence of care, critical study, and acquaintance with the best that our most
competent scholars have contributed to the exposition of the Psalms."&mdash;<i>Critical
Review.</i></p>


<p><b>The Epistles of Peter</b></p>

<p>By the <b>Rev. Prof. LUMBY, D.D.</b>, Cambridge.</p>

<p>"A sound and finely practical commentary."&mdash;<i>Saturday Review.</i></p>

<p>"We have been impressed by the carefulness, fulness, and almost minuteness
of the expositions which Dr. Lumby gives in this volume."&mdash;<i>Literary World.</i></p>

<h2>Seventh Series.</h2>

<h3><i>Subscription Price,</i> 24s. <i>Separate Volumes,</i> 7s. 6d. <i>each.</i></h3>


<p><b>The Epistle to the Romans</b></p>

<blockquote><p>By the <b>Right Rev. HANDLEY C. G. MOULE, M.A., D.D.</b>,
Lord Bishop of Durham.</p></blockquote>

<p>"We do not hesitate to place it in the very front of the little group of
volumes which are the best examples of this carefully edited work. It would
be pleasant to linger upon this commentary, upon the clearness with which the
great evangelical doctrines of the Epistle are explained and enforced, upon the
earnestness of its personal appeal, and the charm which often marks its language;
but the judicious student of the New Testament will obtain the book
for himself."&mdash;<i>Record.</i></p>


<p><b>The Second Book of Kings</b></p>

<blockquote><p>By the <b>Very Rev. F. W. FARRAR, D.D. F.R.S.</b>, Dean of
Canterbury.</p></blockquote>

<p>"For a vivid picture of men and times, and a spirited account of the events
which led to Israel's and Judah's downfall, with fine illustrative use of the
contemporary writings of the prophets, his book is a distinct accession to the
series."&mdash;<i>Glasgow Herald.</i></p>


<p><b>The Books of Chronicles</b></p>

<blockquote><p>By the <b>Rev. W. H. BENNETT, D.D.</b>, Professor of Old
Testament Languages and Literature, Hackney and New
Colleges.</p></blockquote>

<p>"Readers of Mr. Bennett's contribution to 'Faith and Criticism' might
expect that a book written wholly by him would be distinctive and original.
But few could have foreseen that he would produce anything so illuminating,
so broad, so powerful as this volume."&mdash;<i>Daily Chronicle.</i></p>


<p><b>The Second Epistle to the Corinthians</b></p>

<blockquote><p>By the <b>Rev. Prof. JAMES DENNEY, D.D.</b>, Author of "The
Epistles to the Thessalonians," etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>"Mr. Denney's commentary is a masterly one in every respect. Its exegesis
of the text is exact and thorough; its use of the best expositors most helpful;
its final conclusion generally convincing."&mdash;<i>Methodist Times.</i></p>


<p><b>The Book of Numbers</b></p>

<blockquote><p>By the <b>Rev. R. A. WATSON, D.D.</b>, Author of "Judges
and Ruth," etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>"Dr. Watson's exposition may be commended as showing considerable
insight into the deeper meanings of Scripture, and skill in applying them to
the needs and conditions of modern life; ... his book is throughout scholarly
in tone and earnestly written."&mdash;<i>Scotsman.</i></p>


<p><b>The Psalms. Vol. III.</b></p>

<p>By the <b>Rev. ALEXANDER MACLAREN, D.D., D.Lit.</b></p>

<p>"With the exposition of the whole Psalter before us, we may say that for
what it professes to be, the work is very well done, and there has been no
falling off in the third volume from such an amount of excellence as was
attained in the other two."&mdash;<i>Guardian.</i></p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
